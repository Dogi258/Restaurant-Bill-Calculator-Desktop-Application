# Restaurant Bill Calculator Desktop Application 
This project is a desktop application built with the .NET Framework. The user can select food items from multiple drop down menus to add to the total bill. As each item is selected, the running total and subtotal will be calculated at the bottom. The user can click on the Clear Bill Button to restore the subtotal, tax, and total fields to $0.00.
